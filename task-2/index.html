        <h1>The religious quest</h1>
        <p>
          Gandhiâ€™s religious quest dated back to his childhood, the influence of
          his mother and of his home life in Porbandar and Rajkot, but it
          received a great impetus after his arrival in South Africa. His Quaker
          friends in Pretoria failed to convert him to Christianity, but they
          quickened his appetite for religious studies.

        <h1>Return to India</h1>
        <p>
          Gandhi decided to leave South Africa in the summer of 1914, just
          before the outbreak of World War I. He and his family first went to
          London, where they remained for several months. Finally, they departed
          England in December, arriving in Bombay in early January 1915.
