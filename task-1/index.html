      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2,
        1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer,
        politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the
        nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came
        to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally
        esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve
        political and social progress.

      <h1>The religious quest</h1>
      <p>
        Gandhi’s religious quest dated back to his childhood, the influence of
        his mother and of his home life in Porbandar and Rajkot, but it received
        a great impetus after his arrival in South Africa. His Quaker friends in
        Pretoria failed to convert him to Christianity, but they quickened his
        appetite for religious studies.

      <h1>Return to India</h1>
      <p>
        Gandhi decided to leave South Africa in the summer of 1914, just before
        the outbreak of World War I. He and his family first went to London,
        where they remained for several months. Finally, they departed England
        in December, arriving in Bombay in early January 1915.
